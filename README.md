### Current Structure

- `bot/` - Contains the main source code.
- `database/` - Contains the database operations.
- `tests/` - Includes unit and integration tests.

### Proposed Structure for Future Enhancements

This structure is intended to facilitate future growth and make it easier to manage the codebase as the project evolves.
