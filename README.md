This project is a Telegram bot, built with Rust and running on Cloudflare Workers, designed to help users find and schedule meetups.

## Project Overview

The bot leverages the power of Rust for performance and safety, compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm) to run efficiently on the Cloudflare serverless platform. It interacts with Cloudflare services like D1 for database, KV for caching/feature flags, and potentially R2 for storage.

## Project Structure

- `src/lib.rs`: The main library entry point for the Cloudflare Worker.
- `src/<service_name>/mod.rs`: Modular service structure (e.g., `src/user_service/mod.rs`, `src/config_service/mod.rs`).
- `Cargo.toml`: The Rust package manifest, managing dependencies and build settings.
- `worker/`: Output directory for the compiled Wasm binary and JavaScript shim generated by `wasm-pack`.
- `scripts/`: Contains helper shell scripts for common tasks like building, testing, and deploying.
- `Makefile`: Provides convenient `make` commands for development and CI operations.
- `wrangler.toml`: Configuration file for Cloudflare Wrangler CLI, defining environments, bindings, and build settings.
- `docs/`: Contains detailed documentation files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Rust:** Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) (`rustup install stable`).
- **`wasm-pack`:** Install via `curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh`.
- **`wrangler` CLI:** Install via `npm install -g wrangler`. Ensure you can log in (`wrangler login`).
- **Node.js & npm:** Required for Wrangler.
- **Git:** For cloning the repository.

### Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/irfndi/meetsmatch-py.git # Replace with your repo URL if different
    cd meetsmatch-py
    ```
2.  **Set up environment configuration:**
    Run `make setup-dev-env` or `scripts/setup_env_dev.sh`. This creates an `.env.example` file.
    ```bash
    make setup-dev-env
    ```
3.  **Configure local environment:**
    Copy the example file to `.env` and customize it with your local development settings (e.g., Cloudflare account ID, preview KV/D1 IDs if you intend to use them with `wrangler dev`).
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Then edit .env with your specific values
    ```
    Refer to `docs/ENVIRONMENTS.MD` for more details on environment setup.

### Development Cycle
- **Build:** Compile the Rust code to Wasm.
  ```bash
  make build
  # or ./scripts/build.sh
  ```
- **Check Code (Format & Lint):**
  ```bash
  make check
  # or ./scripts/check.sh
  ```
- **Test:** Run unit and integration tests.
  ```bash
  make test
  # or ./scripts/test.sh
  ```
- **Run Locally:** Use `wrangler dev` to run the worker locally, simulating the Cloudflare environment. This typically uses the `[env.dev]` configuration from `wrangler.toml`.
  ```bash
  wrangler dev
  ```

## Key Makefile Commands

- `make all` or `make build`: Build the Rust Wasm worker.
- `make check`: Check formatting (rustfmt) and lint (clippy).
- `make test`: Run tests.
- `make ci`: Run local CI checks (format, lint, test).
- `make deploy-dev`: Deploy to the development environment.
- `make deploy-staging`: Deploy to the staging environment.
- `make deploy-prod`: Deploy to the production environment.
- `make setup-dev-env`: Initialize development environment configuration.
- `make clean`: Remove build artifacts.
- `make help`: Display all available Makefile targets.

## Documentation

For more detailed information, please refer to the `docs/` directory:
- **[DEVELOPMENT.MD](docs/DEVELOPMENT.MD):** Development process, coding conventions, and detailed setup instructions.
- **[TECH.MD](docs/TECH.MD):** Technical details about the architecture, technologies, libraries, and tools used.
- **[FEATURE.MD](docs/FEATURE.MD):** (To be updated) Features of the bot including commands and their descriptions.

## CI/CD

Continuous Integration and Deployment are managed via GitHub Actions. The workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) includes:
- Code formatting checks (`rustfmt`).
- Linting (`clippy`).
- Running tests with code coverage (`cargo-llvm-cov`).
- Building the Wasm worker.
- Deploying to Cloudflare Workers on pushes to the `main` branch (for the production environment).

## Code Coverage

Code coverage is tracked using [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/irfndi/meetsmatch-py). The goal is to maintain high test coverage.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please refer to `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` (if it exists, or create one) and ensure that your contributions pass all CI checks.

*(Self-correction: The GitHub repo URL in badges and clone command should be generic or correct. The current one `irfndi/meetsmatch-py` seems to be a placeholder from the original problem description, but I'll keep it as is for now since I cannot verify the actual URL.)*
